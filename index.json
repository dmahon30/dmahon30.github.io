[{"content":"What I was trying to do  I\u0026rsquo;m trying to expand my skillset when it comes to web design - I\u0026rsquo;ve worked with dynamic websites before like Wordpress and Wix, but I\u0026rsquo;ve never made my own static website. Suffice it to say, I am excited to learn more about how to tweek these sites to suit my design needs. I knew I need to generate a URL via Github, then upload the Hugo template to that rep in order for Github to read it as a website. Static website tutorial   How it connects to my research  I plan on using static sites to host a digital portfolio, as well as hosting the final DH creation project that I\u0026rsquo;m working on.   What I did  step 1: Build site with GH pages.  Created new repository in Github called dmahon30-github-io This format is what allows Github to read the repo as a website.   step 2: Content  Add an .md file to the repo and Github will add it to the web content.   step 3: Enable Pages (Settings of your repo)  Ensure the repo is in the main branch and you\u0026rsquo;ve got a basic website!   step 4: Adding template from Hugo  Download template. Upload according to the Quick Start tutorial. Change the content in the Example.site in lieu of step 4 in the above Quick Start tutorial (easiest way to manipulate the template) and upload that template content to your Github website repo. Note: Need to add the content from the PUBLIC folder generated.    Challenges Biggest challenges for the static website\nAdding the Template\n I needed to move template directory to my ’themes’ folder in my site directory in order for the template to be read.  Pushing local rep (public) to remote repo on Github\n I had to use the command git pull I think and then these commands that were pulled from the command line:  `\tgit commit -m \u0026quot;first commit\u0026quot; git branch -M main git remote add origin [repo URL] git push -u origin main` Resources that I used to Troubleshoot:\n  https://levelup.gitconnected.com/build-a-personal-website-with-github-pages-and-hugo-6c68592204c7\n  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24114676/git-error-failed-to-push-some-refs-to-remote\n  https://adityatelange.github.io/hugo-PaperMod/posts/papermod/papermod-installation/#sample-pagemd\n  https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/\n  perhaps the most important resource is this one:\n Creating a Blog with Hugo in 10 Minutes  Thoughts on where to go next I\u0026rsquo;d like to populate the site with images and sound files, so I\u0026rsquo;m working on that now - wish me luck!\n","permalink":"https://dmahon30.github.io/posts/staticwebdesign/","summary":"What I was trying to do  I\u0026rsquo;m trying to expand my skillset when it comes to web design - I\u0026rsquo;ve worked with dynamic websites before like Wordpress and Wix, but I\u0026rsquo;ve never made my own static website.
